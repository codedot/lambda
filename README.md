This package implements the lambda calculus using
interaction nets, providing CLI and API.

Its browserified version is available as [an online demo][1].

# Algorithms

The following encodings of the lambda calculus are included:

* `closed`, the approach of [arXiv:1304.2290v8][2] applied to
[_An Interaction Net Implementation of Closed Reduction_][3]
by Ian Mackie, this is the default algorithm;

* `optimal`, an implementation of
[_Lambdascope_][5] by Vincent van Oostrom et al;

* `abstract`, an experimental algorithm described in
[arXiv:1701.04691v2][6];

* `hybrid`, an undocumented experimental algorithm.

All versions include the embedded read-back mechanism described
in Section 7 of [10.4204/EPTCS.225.7][4].

`T/B` should be read as total of `T` interactions,
of which `B` were Î²-reductions.

# CLI

This package provides the `lambda` command with the following interface:

```
Usage: lambda [options] (<file> | -e <expr>)

Options:
  --algo, -a     Select algorithm                             [string]
  --debug, -d    Enable step-by-step evaluation              [boolean]
  --expr, -e     Process argument as expression              [boolean]
  --inet, -i     Show interaction net                        [boolean]
  --limit, -l    Limit number of interactions                 [number]
  --perf, -p     Print benchmarks                            [boolean]

```

# Combinators

CLI predefines a number of commonly used combinators:

```
I = x: x;
K = x, y: x;
S = x, y, z: x z (y z);
T = K;
F = K I;
AND = p, q: p q F;
OR = p, q: p T q;
NOT = p: (a, b: p b a);
C0 = f, x: x;
C1 = f, x: f x;
C2 = f, x: f (f x);
C3 = f, x: f (f (f x));
C4 = f, x: f (f (f (f x)));
C5 = f, x: f (f (f (f (f x))));
C6 = f, x: f (f (f (f (f (f x)))));
C7 = f, x: f (f (f (f (f (f (f x))))));
C8 = f, x: f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f x)))))));
C9 = f, x: f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f x))))))));
C10 = f, x: f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f x)))))))));
SUCC = n: (f, x: f (n f x));
PLUS = m, n: (f, x: m f (n f x));
MULT = m, n: (f: m (n f));
EXP = m, n: n m;
PRED = n: (f, x: n (g, h: h (g f)) (K x) I);
MINUS = m, n: n PRED m;
ZERO = n: n (K F) T;
Y = (a: a a) (self, f: f (self self f));
```

# API

`require("@alexo/lambda")` returns a function of a lambda term defined
in a variant of the lambda calculus called Macro Lambda Calculus (MLC)
that allows macro definitions in order to input complex expressions.
The last term in the input is the term whose normal form is to be found.

For developing and testing purposes, the package also exports
two additional functions `.prepare(term)` and `.debug()`.
The `.debug()` function applies a single reduction step to
the interaction net compiled by the previous `.prepare()`
call and returns a human-readable string representation of
the current interaction net state.

# Grammar

Input consists of an optional list of macro definitions and a term:

```
%token NAME /* [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]* */

%%

text : defs term
     ;
defs : /* empty */
     | defs NAME '=' term ';'
     ;
term : appl
     | abst
     ;
abst : NAME ',' abst
     | NAME ':' term
     ;
appl :      atom
     | appl atom
     ;
atom : '(' term ')'
     |     NAME
     ;
```
