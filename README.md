This package implements the lambda calculus using
interaction nets, providing CLI and API.

Its browserified version is available as [an online demo][1].

# Algorithms

The following encodings of the lambda calculus are included:

* `abstract`, an experimental algorithm based on
the ideas from [arXiv:1701.04691v2][6],
this is the default algorithm;

* `closed`, the approach of [arXiv:1304.2290v8][2] applied to
[_An Interaction Net Implementation of Closed Reduction_][3]
by Ian Mackie;

* `optimal`, an implementation of
[_Lambdascope_][5] by Vincent van Oostrom et al;

The embedded read-back mechanism is described
in Section 7 of [10.4204/EPTCS.225.7][4].

# Benchmarks

The following is output of the `test.sh` script provided in the package:

`T/B` should be read as total of `T` interactions,
of which `B` were Î²-reductions.

# CLI

This package provides the `lambda` command with the following interface:

```
Usage: lambda [options] (<term> | -f <file>)

Options:
  --algo, -a     Select algorithm         [string]
  --debug, -d    Evaluate step by step   [boolean]
  --file, -f     Read term from file     [boolean]
  --inet, -i     Show interaction net    [boolean]
  --limit, -l    Limit interactions       [number]
  --perf, -p     Print benchmarks        [boolean]
  --stats, -s    Save statistics to file  [string]
  --term, -t     Output expanded term    [boolean]
  --help, -h     Show help               [boolean]
  --version, -v  Show version number     [boolean]

```

# Combinators

CLI predefines a number of commonly used combinators:

```
I = x: x;
K = x, y: x;
S = x, y, z: x z (y z);
T = K;
F = K I;
AND = p, q: p q F;
OR = p, q: p T q;
NOT = p: (a, b: p b a);
C0 = f, x: x;
C1 = f, x: f x;
C2 = f, x: f (f x);
C3 = f, x: f (f (f x));
C4 = f, x: f (f (f (f x)));
C5 = f, x: f (f (f (f (f x))));
C6 = f, x: f (f (f (f (f (f x)))));
C7 = f, x: f (f (f (f (f (f (f x))))));
C8 = f, x: f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f x)))))));
C9 = f, x: f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f x))))))));
C10 = f, x: f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f x)))))))));
SUCC = n: (f, x: f (n f x));
PLUS = m, n: (f, x: m f (n f x));
MULT = m, n: (f: m (n f));
EXP = m, n: n m;
PRED = n: (f, x: n (g, h: h (g f)) (K x) I);
MINUS = m, n: n PRED m;
ZERO = n: n (K F) T;
Y = (a: a a) (self, f: f (self self f));
```

# API

`require("@alexo/lambda")` returns a function of a lambda term defined
in a variant of the lambda calculus called Macro Lambda Calculus (MLC)
that allows macro definitions in order to input complex expressions.
The last term in the input is the term whose normal form is to be found.

For developing and testing purposes, the package also exports
two additional functions `.prepare(term)` and `.debug()`.
The `.debug()` function applies a single reduction step to
the interaction net compiled by the previous `.prepare()`
call and returns a human-readable string representation of
the current interaction net state.

# Grammar

Input consists of an optional list of macro definitions and a term:

```
%token NAME /* [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]* */

%%

text : defs term
     ;
defs : /* empty */
     | defs NAME '=' term ';'
     ;
term : appl
     | abst
     ;
abst : NAME ',' abst
     | NAME ':' term
     ;
appl :      atom
     | appl atom
     ;
atom : '(' term ')'
     |     NAME
     ;
```
